# FaceDetection
In this project we have three different parts:
1. Face Detection and storing the images, which will further act as our dataset
2. Training a model on our dataset
3. Performing face recognition on the basis of the trained model.

# Under the "FacialDetection" folder, create a folder named "dataset", which will play the following role:
1. Your images that get captured during the execution of "face.py" will be stored here.
2. And these very images will next be used to train the model when we execute the "trainer.py".
